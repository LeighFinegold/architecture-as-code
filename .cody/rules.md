# Cody Modeling Rules (CALM + Financial Domain)

1. Use CALM's defined primitives as defined in the schema only.
2. Avoid using terms outside the metamodel unless defined in the glossary.
3. Reference architectural layers (e.g., Business, Application, Technical) when appropriate.
4. Document data flows explicitly between interfaces using `Flow` objects.
5. Always associate capabilities with responsible actors and interacting systems.
6. Use camelCase for identifiers and PascalCase for model types.
7. Describe each model element using its `description` property â€” no element should be undocumented.

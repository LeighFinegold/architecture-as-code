## Without Interfaces (node-to-node connections)
{{block-architecture this
                     render-interfaces=false
                     include-containers="none"
                     edges="connected"

## With Interfaces on Both Sides
{{block-architecture this
                     render-interfaces=true
                     include-containers="none"
                     edges="connected"
}}

## Interface and containers
{{block-architecture this
                     render-interfaces=true
                     include-containers="all"
}}

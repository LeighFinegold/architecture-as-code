## Basic Architecture Structures

### Structure container composition with no edges
{{block-architecture this include-containers="all"
                     edges="none"
}}

### Single System Composition (with seeded edges i.e. only shows relationships contained in focused nodes)
{{block-architecture this
                     include-containers="all"
                     focus-nodes="system-a"
                     include-children="all"
                     edges="seeded"
}}


### Single System Composition (with all connected edges)
{{block-architecture this
                     include-containers="all"
                     focus-nodes="system-a"
                     include-children="all"
                     edges="connected"
}}

### Multiple Systems with Connections
{{block-architecture this
                     include-containers="all"
                     edges="connected"
}}
